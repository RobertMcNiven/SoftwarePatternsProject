# Dungeon Knight
This is a top-down Diablo-like dungeon-crawler prototype built for our Programming II (Object Oriented Programming) integration project. It features a playable Knight with a basic attack function, and different enemies to slay. We planned a selectable class system, customizable level-up system, and randomized levels and item drops, but due to time, the prototype lacks these features. It will have a discoverable map and real-time HUD with an active inventory management system and an optional story. Hopefully, it will have support for multiplayer in the future. This project is a collaboration between Michael D'Agostino, Elijah Nieves, and Robert McNiven.

## Controls
Use WASD or the arrow keys to move. Use 'J' to attack


## Documentation
For this game we wrote all of our scripts in C#. We are using standard formatting with XML tags and [this coding style](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md) from another GitHub repository.


## Getting Started
Although our game is not complete, we want to release it on Steam so others can play and enjoy it just as we have making it.


## Built With

 - Visual Studio
 - Unity Game Engine

## History
At first it was going to be a JRPG style game but it has turned more into a skill based dungeon crawler where you want to complete levels, kill enemies and survive! We chose to focus on making the game more dynamic, in these few months that we had, to make it easy to implement enemies and levels, rather than having a lot them.
